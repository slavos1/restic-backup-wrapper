**restic-backup-wrapper-cli** is a command-line tool that generates
`restic backup` commands from a TOML config file.

The output is suitable for piping to a (Posix) shell.

<div class="caution">

*Please note although this script is provided in the hope it will be
[useful](LICENSE), use caution when running it. Always review the
generated restic commands, as improper use could potentially damage your
backup data.*

# Example

Given a TOML file:

**`min.toml`.**

``` toml
# minimal sample config
relative-to = "~/"
group-by = "host,paths,tags"
# will be added to all backups
exclude = ['.git']

[my-folder-one]
dir = "~/my-folder-one"
tags = ['mobile', 'voice', 'audio']
exclude = [".hg"]

[folder-with-one-backup]
dir = "~/my-mail"
tags = ['email']
keep-last = 1
```

restic-backup-wrapper-cli generates [`restic
backup`](https://restic.readthedocs.io/en/latest/040_backup.html)
commands (logs not shown):

``` shell
# Generated by restic-backup-wrapper-cli 0.2.0 on 2024-04-05 03:34:58.558122+00:00
# commands for key 'my-folder-one'
(cd ~/ && restic backup my-folder-one --group-by host,paths,tags --tag audio,mobile,voice -e .git -e .hg)
# commands for key 'folder-with-one-backup'
(cd ~/ && restic backup my-mail --group-by host,paths,tags --tag email -e .git)
(cd ~/ && restic forget --prune --keep-last 1 --path /home/slavos/my-mail)
```

    install --user hatch`

# How to use

``` shell
# run the CLI
hatch run cli
make cli

# run the CLI help
hatch run help
make help

# or append any CLI-defined args, like --help
hatch run cli --help
make cli EXTRA='...'

# run mypy
hatch run types:check
make mypy

# run tests
make
hatch run test

# go to the venv shell
hatch shell

make doc

# increase version
hatch version <new-version>
```

# Local install and run

``` shell
rm -rf dist/
hatch build
pipx install dist/*.whl
restic-backup-wrapper-cli --version
restic-backup-wrapper-cli --help

# or you can use
make local
```

# Input file format

`-i`/`--input-file` is a TOML file of the following format.

## Global parameters

  - `restic-repo` (optional)  
    If specified, `restic -r <restic-repo>` will be generated. If not
    specified `-r XXX` will omitted. I do not use this flag as my
    `restic` is actually a custom alias/wrapper that sets my restic repo
    password as an environment variable.

  - `relative-to` (optional)  
    If specified, all `dir` paths (see below) that are relative to this
    path will be backed up as relative.
    
    <div class="informalexample">
    
    If `relative-to="X"` and a `dir="X/Y"` then the generated command
    will be `(cd X && restic backup Y …​)`
    
    </div>

  - `group-by` (optional)  
    Translates to --group-by restic flag. It will be omitted from the
    generated command if not specified.

  - `exclude` (optional)  
    Add these exclude patterns to every generated command. The
    folder-specific excludes will be merged with this exclude, if any.

## Backed up folders

Each key of the form `[my-dir]` represents a folder to be backed up and
for which a `restic backup` command will be generated.

For each such entry, restic-backup-wrapper-cli recognizes these
parameters:

  - `dir` (mandatory)  
    Path to back up; if `relative-to` is set in the global parameters to
    a path `X`, `dir` will end up backed up as relative to `X` if it is
    a descendant path of `X`; otherwise it is kept as is.

  - `tags` (optional)  
    A list of tags; tags `['x','a tag with space']` will end up as
    `restic backup …​ --tag 'a tag with space,x' …​` (spaces in the tags
    are allowed).

  - `exclude` (optional)  
    Exclude patterns relevant to this folder. These patterns, if any,
    will be merged with the global `exclude`.

  - `keep-last` (optional; added in version `0.2.0`)  
    Generate *another* line to keep only the specified number of
    snapshots, something like `restic …​ forget --prune --keep-last <N>
    --path <full-folder-path>`.

# restic and relative paths

According to [the restic
author](https://forum.restic.net/t/backing-up-restoring-relative-paths/744/2),
restic keeps relative and absolute paths. It is not obvious from `restic
snaphots` where only absolute paths are shown. Running `restic ls
<snapshot-id>` for a snapshot backed up from a relative path will show
`/` as the "parent" path (and not the full path).

*So one should imagine how `tar` does it.*

# Writing documentation

When writing documentation, I run `make doc-devel` and preview the
generated HTML.

Once ready to commit, I run `make doc` to generate
[README.md](README.md) file from [readme.adoc](readme.adoc) (and
included files).
